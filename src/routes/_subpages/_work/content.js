                The goal was simple: to win the Super Bowl. We knew Tide was the
                number one detergent brand in America. That insight alone made us
                realize that being at the top probably meant the majority of the
                clothes featured in other ads would have been washed with it. The
                clients played a vital role in finding the perfect brand partners
                within Procter to bring the idea to life in the best possible way. The
                rest is history.
